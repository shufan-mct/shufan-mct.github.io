Hi, this is Shufan. I am a PhD student in Physics at Indiana University, advised by Prof. [W. Michael Snow](https://physics.indiana.edu/about/directory/all-faculty-scientists/snow-w.html).

My [research](https://shufan-mct.github.io/research/) focuses on microscopic neutron entanglement theory, specifically the neutron state evolution in the interferometer. My work gives operational explanations on how the neutron interacts with the [entanglement devices](https://shufan-mct.github.io/research/#multimode-entangled-single-neutron-interferometry) and calculates the [decoherence rate](https://shufan-mct.github.io/research/#decoherence-in-mirror-reflection-of-two-state-neutron-superpositions-with-strong-absorption) of the neutron upon mirror reflection.

My broader research interests also include [quantum computing](https://shufan-mct.github.io/research/#solving-lights-out-and-asteroids-puzzles-using-grovers-algorithm) and [quantum optical experiments](https://shufan-mct.github.io/research/#two-mode-entangled-single-photon-interferometry).

In my spare time, I enjoy paddle boarding, musical theater and traveling.
