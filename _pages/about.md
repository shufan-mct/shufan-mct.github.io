Hi, this is Shufan. I am a PhD student in Physics at Indiana University, advised by Prof. [W. Michael Snow](https://physics.indiana.edu/about/directory/all-faculty-scientists/snow-w.html).

My [research](https://shufan-mct.github.io/research/) focuses on microscopic neutron entanglement theory, specifically the neutron state evolution in the interferometer. My work gives operational explanations on how the neutron interacts with the entanglement devices and calculates the decoherence rate of the neutron upon mirror reflection.

My broader research interests also include quantum computing and quantum optical experiments.

Besides physics research, I am passionate about programming and machine learning. I have worked on multiple machine learning projects.

In my spare time, I enjoy paddle boarding, musical theater and traveling.
