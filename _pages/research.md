## Multimode-Entangled Single-Neutron Interferometry

Conventional neutron interferometry, employing devices constructed from large perfect single crystals of silicon, has been used to explore various foundational aspects of quantum mechanics. Although neutron spin-echo devices are often viewed in terms of Larmor precession of the neutron spin, under special physical conditions, the action of these devices is more suitably interpreted in terms of neutron interferometry and quantum entanglement. 

I develop an operator-based description of two types of multimode-entangled single-neutron quantum optical devices: Wollaston prisms and radio-frequency spin flippers in inclined magnetic field gradients. This treatment is similar to the approach used in quantum optics, and is convenient for the analysis of quantum contextuality measurements in certain types of neutron interferometers.

I describe operationally the way multimode-entangled single-neutron states evolve in these devices, and provide expressions for the associated operators describing the dynamics, in the limit in which the neutron state space is approximated by a finite tensor product of distinguishable subsystems. 

I design entangled-neutron interferometers to measure entanglement witnesses for the Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt, and Mermin inequalities, and compare the theoretical predictions with our recent experimental results. 

We view this work as a necessary first step towards a theoretical description of entangled neutron scattering from strongly entangled matter.

## Decoherence in Mirror Reflection of Two-state Neutron Superpositions with Strong Absorption

_Work in Progress_

The theory of single-particle entangled neutron scattering from entangled degrees of freedom in condensed matter is under development. By the optical theorem of scattering theory, entanglement-dependent effects in nonforward scattering must also appear at some level in the forward direction, which is the domain of neutron optics. I have been taking steps toward this development and applying them in neutron-antineutron oscillations under mirror reflection conditions.
