## Computer Vision – Image Classification

_September 2021_

`Python`; `pandas`, `TensorFlow`

*	Built and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify 60,000 images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into ten categories with 74.3% accuracy.
*	Augmented the training samples by adding random rotations and translations, further improving the classification accuracy to 75.6%.

## Natural Language Processing (NLP) – Spam Classification 

_August 2021_

`Python`; `pandas`, `scikit-learn`

* Transformed natural English words gathered from email messages into numerical vectors using count vectorization.
* Built a naïve Bayes classifier to distinguish spam emails from legitimate emails with 98.9% accuracy.

## Movie Recommendation System

_July 2021_

`Python`; `pandas`, `NumPy`

*	Analyzed the correlations between ratings given to different movies using pandas and NumPy.
*	Constructed an item-based collaborative filter from the correlation matrix to predict users’ ratings based on their watching and rating history.

## Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Implementation – Time Series Prediction

_April 2020_

`Python`

*	Implemented a RNN from scratch, optimized using gradient descent with backpropagation.
*	Evaluated the RNN with a time series of a noisy sine wave, correctly predicting subsequent values.
